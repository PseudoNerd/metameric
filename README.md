# tilapia

First install with

```
python3 setup.py install
```

Then, you can run tilapia with

```
python3 -m tilapia -i MY_INPUT_FILE -o MY_OUTPUT_FILE
```

For a quick example, use `example.csv` as `MY_INPUT_FILE`

You can run the web demo using

```
python3 -m tilapia.web
```

Again, use `example.csv` as a quick example.
In the web demo you will sometimes encounter a thing called `Parameter File`.
This should be left empty.
